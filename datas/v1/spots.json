Since 2004, the bar has served as a refuge for an array of locals: from writers and start-ups on laptops, and office folks grabbing a tasty lunch by day,  to musicians, artists, locals and even the occasional sailor or two by night. We are proud to have been the last Seaport bar the Fulton Fish Market workers called home. With the area\u2019s recent revitalization, the bar now feels old-school, an homage to the neighborhoods history.  Fresh Salt was nearly destroyed in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Thanks to the amazing generosity and crowd sourcing of our friends, family and regulars, Fresh Salt was able to rebuild. The integrity and feel of the interior was maintained and even improved in some ways. Most people can\u2019t pick out what\u2019s different! We are proud to be a part of this close-knit community within the oldest neighborhood in New York. Fresh Salt is New York City\u2019s local."}, {"SPOT_NAME": "Fresno 2 Gourmet Deli", "ADDRESS": "31 Avenue C", "BOROUGH": "Manhattan", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 10009, "AREA_NAME": "East Village", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(212) 253-1500"}, {"SPOT_NAME": "Freud", "ADDRESS": "506 Laguardia Pl", "BOROUGH": "Manhattan", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 10012, "AREA_NAME": "Greenwich Village", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(212) 777-0327", "EMAIL": "eat@freudnyc.com", "SPOT_DESC": "Located in Greenwich Village, this restaurant evokes a turn-of-the-century brasserie from Sigmund Freud's native Vienna.

Though we found ourselves jobless we became full of hope and optimism. This was the push we needed to realize our collective dream and in hindsight we couldn't have been luckier.

In the neighborhood famous for its bars and restaurants, Kitty Kiernans stands out for its authentic Irish Pub look and feel and outstanding service. The local landmark status of Kitty Kiernans was assured when Director Spike Lee chose the establishment to serve as one of the main location shots for his film, The 25th Hour. Kitty\u2019s peerless exterior, with a spectacular view of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, and its authentic Irish Pub interior made it the perfect choice for a film set in an Irish-American community. The 25th Hour stars Ed Norton, who portrays a man spending his last night of freedom before serving a prison sentence, and Brian Cox, who plays his father, the pub owner."}, {"SPOT_NAME": "Kiwiana", "ADDRESS": "847 Union St", "BOROUGH": "Brooklyn", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 11215, "AREA_NAME": "Park Slope", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(718) 230-3682", "EMAIL": "info@kiwiana-nyc.com", "SPOT_DESC": "NYC's premiere New Zealand cuisine brought to you by Chef Mark Simmons."}, {"SPOT_NAME": "Klimat", "ADDRESS": "77 E 7th St", "BOROUGH": "Manhattan", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 10003, "AREA_NAME": "East Village", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(917) 214-0589", "EMAIL": "klimatlounge@gmail.com"}, {"SPOT_NAME": "Klong", "ADDRESS": "7 St Marks Pl", "BOROUGH": "Manhattan", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 10003, "AREA_NAME": "East Village", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(212) 505-9955", "EMAIL": "klongthainyc@gmail.com"}, {"SPOT_NAME": "Knickerbocker Bar & Grill", "ADDRESS": "33 University Pl", "BOROUGH": "Manhattan", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 10003, "AREA_NAME": "Greenwich Village", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(212) 228-8490", "EMAIL": "knickrd@aol.com", "SPOT_DESC": "Knickerbocker Bar & Grill, located in the heart of Greenwich village, is a neighborhood favorite.

America out of Cobh in County Cork. Teddy & Maggie both started out in retail; Teddy as a shoe salesmen and Maggie at Elizabeth Arden. They then worked together in the Irish Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair.  Later Teddy moved on to Downey's, a famous theater bar on 8th avenue. Teddy would tell great stories about playing cards after hours at Jason Robard's apartment (with Lauren Bacall yelling at them to go home) and of Peter O'Toole dancing on the bar.  At the same time Maggie worked at the Irish Pavilion on 57th St before Tommy Makem owned it. Maggie's Place is oldest family-owned restaurant & bar in the Midtown area. In 1992 Maggie & Teddy's son Martin took over Maggie's Place, renovated the space and brought in his brother Mark, a Culinary Institute of America alumnus. They have built on their parents American Dream and now own 11 other restaurants throughout Manhattan.  In 2007 Martin had his first child. Her name? Maggie (Margaret when she's misbehaving).

Then, in 1974, the Irish moved in. The \u201cOld Stream\u201d became the \u201cMinstrel Boy,\u201d founded by an Irish-born, retired NYPD officer. The handle changed, but the regulars still sat in their same stools and kept up their old traditions. The tight-knit, community bar, continued on much the same as it had been. Then, in 1979, Ryan\u2019s Daughter was born. The new owners gave her a major facelift as well as a second bar on the upper floor. She turned a few heads, as the 1980\u2019s brought new faces to old places on the Upper East Side. The crowd came in and rubbed shoulders with the old-timers. Ryan\u2019s Daughter charmed many of them with her friendliness to all. And so they stayed on, becoming familiar faces themselves.

Ryan\u2019s Daughter is a proud member of this ever-changing community. All grown up, she has held on to the charms of her younger days and picked up a bit of wisdom.

After all, we are the funniest neighborhood in Queens! We grew from a sprawling dive bar that was open 6 days a week to come to be named \u201cThe gem of the Queens comedy scene\u201d by Time Out New York.\u201d On January 5th, 2005, I was meeting a man about a play and stumbled into this amazing oasis for creativity. I hadn\u2019t so much as poured a pint of beer or served a plate of food before I came to The Creek and The Cave, and yet eighteen months later I became its proprietress. The Creek and The Cave quickly evolved into a development space for some of the best comedians that New York City has to offer. Louis C.K. dropped in awhile back, Colin Quinn developed his internationally touring one man show Unconstitutional here, James Adomian continues to be a regular on Comedy Bang Bang and Donald Glover (NBC\u2019s Community, Childish Gambino), an original Creek comedian says, \u201cI had a lot of firsts here. I did my first stand up here. My first live concert was here. The Creek changed my life. I wouldn\u2019t be here without you and your influence.\u201d"}, {"SPOT_NAME": "The Crooked Knife", "ADDRESS": "29 E 30th St", "BOROUGH": "Manhattan", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 10016, "AREA_NAME": "Midtown", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(212) 696-2593", "EMAIL": "ck30@thecrookedknife.com", "SPOT_DESC": "While exploring the history of the area, we found that 30th Street was considered at one time, and still by some, to be the northern boundary of Gramercy. the name, \u201cGramercy\", is an Anglicization of \"CROMESSIE\", itself  DERIVED FROM THE DUTCH, KROM MESJE, OR \"LITTLE CROOKED KNIFE\" the name of a small brook or stream meandering like a 'CROOKED LITTLE KNIFE\u2019 or 'CROM MESSIE.' ... the decision was made to drop the 'little'... and 'THE CROOKED KNIFE\" was born!!"}, {"SPOT_NAME": "The Crown Inn", "ADDRESS": "724 Franklin Ave", "BOROUGH": "Brooklyn", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 11238, "AREA_NAME": "Crown Heights", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(347) 915-1131", "SPOT_DESC": "Cavernous bar with exposed brick & Prohibition-style furnishings serving craft cocktails & beer."}, {"SPOT_NAME": "The Crown Room", "ADDRESS": "39-17 Bell Blvd", "BOROUGH": "Queens", "CITY": "New York", "STATE": "NY", "ZIP_CODE": 11361, "AREA_NAME": "Bayside", "PHONE_NUMBER": "(347) 235-4580", "EMAIL": "thecrownroombayside@gmail.com", "SPOT_DESC": "Hosting on an impressive two floors, The Crown Room keeps 20 taps flowing with a rotation of your favorite beer from Budweiser to Brooklyn Brewery to Angry Orchard Ros\u00e9.

However the road does not exist anymore. In 1977 when we took over the property we turned it into the ORIGINAL CRAB SHANTY RESTAURANT. Before it was named the Original Crab Shanty Restaurant, we had a couple of other names we wanted to call the restaurant. One of our first choices where \"THE POST OFFICE\" but because of legalities we where turned down by the federal government. That's how the Original Crab Shanty's name was born.
