[["Do they taste good?", {"entities": []}], ["NER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists . Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semi-supervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort.\nState-of-the-Art NER Models\nspaCy NER Model :", {"entities": []}], ["What is Named Entity Recognition?", {"entities": []}], ["gluten free", {"entities": []}], ["+", {"entities": []}]]
